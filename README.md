### Hey there!

I am a student at Dokuz Eylul University. I'm currently working on JavaScript, ASP.NET Core, and PHP. Besides the projects below I have developed myself as a web developer by practicing, reviewing some open-source projects, and new technologies. Now I am looking forward to gaining more experience.
